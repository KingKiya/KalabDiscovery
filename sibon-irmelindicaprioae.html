									<p>Sibon irmelindicaprioae is a species of nonvenomous snake in the subfamily Dipsadinae. It is endemic to Panama. The discovery was made by the Ecuadorian biologist Alejandro Arteaga and the Panamanian biologist Abel Batista in 2023. Sibon irmelindicaprioae belongs to the genus Sibon, and subfamily Dipsadinae. This is also called DiCaprio’s snail-eating snake. Located in the Choco-Darren forests of eastern Panama and western Colombia, DiCaprio’s snail-eating snake (sibon irmelindicapriyo) is the rarest of these newly discovered snake species.</p>
									<p>Creeping among the bushes in the jungles of the foothills of Panama, there is a snake the color of burnt coals, with round eyes like burning coals. Snake, soon to be named after DiCaprio’s snail-eating snake (sibon irmelindicapriyo), is one of five new species living in the forests of Central and South America. In a new study, researchers describe the new species and shed light on how Sleep And other surprising snakes may be at risk from copper mining operations in the area.
									</p>
									<p>“These new species of snake are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of new species discoveries in this region,” lead author alejandro artega, said the president and research director of the Khamai Foundation, a conservation-focused NGO in a statement. “But if illegal mining continues at this rate, there may not be an opportunity to make any discoveries in the future.”</p>
									<p>Sibon Irmelindikapriyo Its name is derived from actor and conservationist Leonardo DiCaprio, who asked that the red-eyed snake be named after his mother, Irmelin Indenbirken. DiCaprio’s eponymous snake is about 15 inches (38 cm) long, and spends its evenings on palm fronds 10 feet (3 m) above the ground, foraging for snails and slugs. To a fault, the snake defends itself not by biting but by wrapping itself protectively around its head and emitting a foul odor.
									</p>
									<p>The other four new species described in the study, published on January 25 in the journal zookies, there are canopy snail-eating snakes (Sibon Canopy), Marley’s snail-eating snake (Sibon Marley), Vieira’s snail-eating snake (Sibon Viarai), and the Welborn’s snail-eating snake (Dipsus wellborni),</p>
									<p>It is the canopy snail-eating snake (Cibon canopy) that is named in honor of the Canopy Family Reserve of Reserve. It is one of the new species of snake discovered in the forests of Central and South America. Marley’s snail-eating snake (Cibon marleyae) was discovered in the most humid and ancient Choco rainforests of Ecuador and Colombia. The snake is named after the daughter of conservationist Brian Sheth. Viera’s snail-eating snake (Cibon vieraei) has a much darker coloration than the others. Welborn’s snail-eating snake (Dipsus welbornii) is the namesake of David Welborn, a former member of the Foundation for Nature and Culture International.
									</p>
									<p>To identify the new species, Arteaga and his colleagues built an evolutionary tree of the Dipsadines – a large and diverse subfamily of arboreal, terrestrial and aquatic snakes found in the Americas – after analyzing 343 sequences from the snake dna, The scientists determined that the five species were sufficiently different from their closest relatives in both appearance and genetics to qualify as new species. DiCaprio’s Snake, for example, doesn’t look much different from the instant siphonops annulatus, a fellow dipsadine. But in addition to genetic differences, the two species have distinct color patterns along their backs and heads, among other telltale signs that they’re not quite the same.</p>
									<p>Unfortunately, most of these new snail-eating species face substantial challenges; The authors think DiCaprio’s snake already fits the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s criteria for “near-threatened”, because gold and copper mining operations are ravaging the rainforests the snakes call home. Huh. According to the statement, all five snake species are arboreal, meaning they cannot survive in deforested areas, and all rely on a steady diet of slugs and snails that feed on mining-related pollution in streams and rivers. Reasons are in decline.</p>
									<p>Illegal gold mining activities in Napo Province, Ecuador are a threat to tree snakes.</p>
									<p>The challenge is largely in Ecuador and Colombia illegal open pit gold mines, which recently emerged in response to a regional gold rush that has led to violence against park rangers and conservationists who stand in the way deforestation, “When I first discovered the rainforests of the Nangarita River in 2014, I remembered that this place was an undiscovered and unspoiled paradise,” Arteaga said. “Actually, the place is called Nuevo Paraiso [New Paradise] In Spanish, but it’s not heaven anymore. Hundreds of illegal gold miners using backhoe loaders have taken over the riverbeds, which are now eroded and turned to rubble.”
									</p>
									<p>In Panama, where DiCaprio’s snake lives, the problem is legal copper mining.</p>
									<p>“Both legal and illegal mines are uninhabitable for snail-eating snakes,” Arteaga said, “but legal mines may be the lesser of two evils.” At the very least they respect the boundary of nearby protected areas, the answer is a higher authority, and is probably unlikely to impose violence on park rangers, researchers and conservationists.”</p>
